        <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Known for its platform independence, Java applications can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), following the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy. It is widely used for web applications, mobile apps (especially Android), and enterprise software. Java supports strong memory management and a rich set of libraries.

             Basic Syntax: 
             <pre><code>
            public class HelloWorld {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                }
            }
        </code></pre>
             
            
            The  main  method is the entry point. Java programs are enclosed in classes, and  System.out.println  prints output.</p>
