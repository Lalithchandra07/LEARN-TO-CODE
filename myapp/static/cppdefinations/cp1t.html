        <p>C++ is a powerful, high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of the C programming language. It supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming, making it versatile for various applications, including software development, game programming, and system-level programming. C++ enhances C by adding features like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and templates.

            A simple "Hello, World!" program in C++ is as follows:
            
            <pre><code>
            #include <iostream>
            using namespace std;
            
            int main() {
                cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
                return 0;
            }
        </code></pre>
            
            This code includes the `iostream` library for input/output and uses `cout` to print the message to the screen.</p>
