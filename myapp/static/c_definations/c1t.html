        <p>C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and applications requiring high performance. C provides low-level memory access, portability, and a rich set of libraries. Its syntax is simple and forms the basis of many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python.

            A basic "Hello, World!" program in C looks like this:<br><br>
            
            <pre><code>
            #include <stdio.h><br>
            
            int main() {<br>
                printf("Hello, World!\n");<br>
                return 0;<br>
            }</code></pre><br>
            <br>
            This code includes the `stdio.h` library for input/output, defines the `main` function, and uses `printf` to display "Hello, World!" on the screen.</p>
