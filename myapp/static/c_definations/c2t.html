        <p>In C, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution. A variable has a specific type, such as `int`, `float`, or `char`, which defines the kind of data it can hold. Variables must be declared before use and follow a syntax specifying the type and name. They are stored in memory and can have different scopes (local, global, or static).

             Syntax: <br><br>
          
            data_type variable_name = value;
           
            
             Example: 
            <pre><code>
            int age = 25;        // Integer variable
            float pi = 3.14;     // Floating-point variable
            char grade = 'A';    // Character variable
        </code></pre>
            
            Variables make programs dynamic and flexible.</p>
