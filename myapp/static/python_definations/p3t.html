<p>In Python, if, elif, and else are conditional statements used to control the flow of a program based on conditions. The if statement checks the first condition; if true, its block executes. If the if condition is false, the elif (short for "else if") statement checks another condition. You can include multiple elif statements. If none of the conditions in if or elif are true, the else block executes as a fallback.
