<p>Conditional operators in Python, also known as comparison operators, are used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False). These operators are commonly used in conditional statements like if to control program flow. 
<br><br>
    The main conditional operators are:<br>
    - **==**: Equal to  <br>
    - **!=**: Not equal to  <br>
    - **>**: Greater than  <br>
    - **<**: Less than  <br>
    - **>=**: Greater than or equal to  <br>
    - **<=**: Less than or equal to  <br>
    <br>
     Example:<br>
<pre><code>
    x = 10
    y = 20
    
    if x < y:
           print("x is less than y")  # Output: x is less than y
        
    if x != y:
            print("x and y are not equal")  # Output: x and y are not equal
        </code></pre>
    These operators are essential for decision-making in Python.</p>    </div>
