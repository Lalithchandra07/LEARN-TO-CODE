<p>In Python, 2D arrays are represented using nested lists, where each inner list represents a row. They are useful for storing data in a grid-like structure, such as matrices or tables. You can access elements using double indexing (array[row][column]). Python provides powerful libraries like  NumPy  for efficient operations on 2D arrays, including element-wise operations and slicing.

     Example:
    <pre><code>
    # 2D Array using nested lists
    array = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]
    
    # Accessing elements
    print(array[1][2])  # Output: 6 (2nd row, 3rd column)
    
    # Iterating through the array
    for row in array:
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp     print(row)
        
    # Modifying an element
    array[0][0] = 10
    print(array)  # Output: [[10, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
     
    
    For advanced 2D array handling, use  NumPy .</code></pre></p>    </div>
