        <p><b>Introduction:  </b>Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax.It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code.<br>  The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).<br> 

            There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.<br> 
            
            For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.<br><br>
        Syntax:<br>
           <pre><code>print("Welcome to learn to code .")</code></pre></p>
