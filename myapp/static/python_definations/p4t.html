        <p>Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate relationships between them. The three main logical operators are:
<br>
            -  and : Returns True if both conditions are true.<br>
            -  or : Returns True if at least one condition is true.<br>
            -  not : Reverses the result of a condition.<br><br>
            
            These operators are commonly used in control structures like if statements to make decisions based on multiple conditions.

             Example:
            
            x = 10
            y = 20
            
            # Using logical operators
            if x > 5 and y < 25:
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   print("Both conditions are true")  # Output: Both conditions are true
            
            if x > 15 or y > 15:
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   print("At least one condition is true")  # Output: At least one condition is true
            
            print(not(x > 15))  # Output: True (reverses the result)</code></pre>
