        <p>In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data. Variables can be declared using three keywords:  var ,  let , and  const . 
<br><br>
            -   var  : The traditional keyword, function-scoped (older).<br>
            -   let  : Block-scoped, recommended for most modern code.<br>
            -   const  : Also block-scoped, used for variables that cannot be reassigned.<br>
            
             Basic Syntax: 
             <pre><code>
            let name = "Alice";  // Declare with let
            const age = 30;      // Declare with const, value cannot be changed
            var city = "New York"; // Declare with var (older approach)
        </code></pre>
            
            Variables can hold different types of data like strings, numbers, and objects.  let  and  const  are more commonly used in modern JavaScript for better scoping and immutability.</p>
