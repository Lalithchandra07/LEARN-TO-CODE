        <p>In JavaScript, constants are variables whose values cannot be reassigned once they are set. They are declared using the `const` keyword. Constants are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block where they are defined. While the value of a constant cannot be changed, if the constant holds an object or array, its properties or elements can still be modified.

             Basic Syntax: 
            <pre><code>
            const PI = 3.14159;  // Constant with a numeric value
            const name = "Alice"; // Constant with a string value
        </code></pre>
            
            Constants help improve code reliability by ensuring that values remain constant throughout the program, reducing the risk of accidental reassignment.</p>
