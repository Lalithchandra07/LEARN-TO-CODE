        <p>Kotlin is a modern, statically-typed programming language developed by JetBrains. It is designed to be concise, expressive, and interoperable with Java, making it ideal for Android app development and other JVM-based projects. Kotlin offers features like null safety, extension functions, and a rich standard library, improving developer productivity and reducing boilerplate code.

             Basic Syntax: 
            <pre><code>
            fun main() {
                val name = "Kotlin"  // Immutable variable
                var age = 5          // Mutable variable
                println("Hello, $name! Age: $age")
            }
            
        </code></pre>
            Kotlin's compatibility with Java and its elegant syntax have made it a popular choice for modern software development, especially in Android programming. </p>
